I wanted to clean up files on my computer to look more put together in my music library. I found I had downloaded a lot of music with artist names/numbers in the title. This is my first Python project. I used ChatGPT to explain the process and looked up some syntax stuff that was just not working. This is my first dip into programming and I have to say I understand why this is so many people's passion. 

Please suggest any changes you can to make this a better program. I am still learning. 

Thanks, 
Neil G
